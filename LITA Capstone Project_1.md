- OrderID, 
- CustomerID,

### Analysis Objectives
By the end of this Analysis, I hope to:

- Analyze monthly sales trends.
- Calculate metrics like average sales per product and total revenue by region.
- Visualize the top-performing products and monthly sales trends.

### Methodology
To carry out my analysis, Using Microsoft Excel as my analysis tool, I performed the following tasks:

### Key Findings
- Top-Performing Products: Among the six products—Gloves, Hat, Jackets, Shirt, Shoes, and Socks—Shoes emerged as the top-selling item, with total sales amounting to 3,087,500.
- Revenue by Region: Revenue analysis across four regions—East, North, South, and West—revealed that the South region generated the most revenue, totaling 4,675,000. 
- Monthly Trends: Displayed with a line graph, showing monthly fluctuations in sales; Sales trends across months showed that in 2023, February had the highest sales, with July as a close second. In 2024, February again led with the highest sales, followed closely by January

### Recommendations
- Consider targeting the south regions with additional marketing to increase sales,
- Focus on inventory management for shoes to meet growing demand, and
- Regularly update customer data to maintain accurate subscription insights.
