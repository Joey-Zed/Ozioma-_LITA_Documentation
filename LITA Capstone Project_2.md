## Microsoft Excel Data analysis

Using Microsoft Excel, I ensured the data was properly validated , checking for data types and null values. After which to carry out my analysis, i created pivot tables that summarised the data, enabling me to acquire insights on my customer data. This insights were then visualised to communicating the insights with charts.

### Data Analysis and Visualizations

### Revenue Generated 
Purpose: To analyze revenue contributions from each region.

#### Findings:

The South region has the highest revenue, although the difference is marginal across regions, as shown by both the pie and bar charts.
A zero-based bar chart and pie chart reveal that revenue contributions are relatively balanced across regions.
